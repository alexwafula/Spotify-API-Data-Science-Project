[PlayFy (Available Soon)]()

PlayFy is a web application where spotify users can see some interesting stats of their public playlists, such as main artists and albums presents on the playlist.

You can see the main functions that are used on the project in a more visual way with this [Notebook](https://github.com/victorleaoo/Spotify-API-Data-Science-Project/blob/main/spotify_api.ipynb).

PlayFy uses the Spotify API with Python. The main Python packages and libraries used were [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.19.0/) and [Plotly/Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).
